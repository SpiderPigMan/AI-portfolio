## 🌟 Project Vision
Adaptive Talent AI is more than just a portfolio; it is a **Technical & Cultural Fit Assessment Tool** powered by Artificial Intelligence. It leverages a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to act as a digital technical consultant that lives within my professional profile.

The goal is to move beyond static CVs, allowing recruiters to interact with a "digital twin" of my experience that can reason about how my background fits their specific needs.

## 🧠 The AI Engine: Responsible RAG
Unlike generic chatbots, this system is grounded in an **Exclusive Knowledge Base** containing my professional trajectory:
- **Critical & Legacy Systems:** Deep experience in maintenance and modernization (Java 6).
- **Large-Scale Architectures:** Unification of complex ecosystems (+60 applications).
- **Modern Development:** Advanced Frontend with Angular 18 and AI integration.

### 🛡️ Responsible AI & Privacy Commitment
- **Total Privacy:** Data from job descriptions or PDFs uploaded by users is processed ephemerally for analysis and is **never** used to train public models or shared with third parties.
- **Technical Honesty:** The AI is programmed to pivot based on similar experiences and demonstrate my adaptive learning capacity (proven by this AI Master's degree) when technological gaps are detected.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular 18 + GSAP (High-performance animations).
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) - Agility and power for AI services.
- **AI Orchestration:** LangChain & OpenAI GPT-4o.
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB (Semantic search of experience).

## 📊 Key Features
1. **Real-Time Fit Analysis:** Upload a Job Description and receive a compatibility report.
2. **Intelligent Chat:** Ask technical or soft skills questions to a bot with professional wit.
3. **Project Showcase:** Interactive visualization of milestones in Banking, Telco, and Public Administration sectors.
